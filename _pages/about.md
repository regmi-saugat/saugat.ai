My name is Saugat Regmi, a Computer Science student at Tribhuwan University, Nepal. I am committed to advancing my knowledge and expertise in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. My passion for Python programming and a desire to stay current with the latest technologies drives my curiosity and enthusiasm for learning.

 Through this blog, I aim to document my journey as a Machine Learning practitioner, sharing my insights and experiences with others in order to facilitate their growth and development. Additionally, I hope to use this platform to reflect on my own learnings and enhance my understanding of this rapidly evolving field.
