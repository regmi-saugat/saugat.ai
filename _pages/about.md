My name is Saugat Regmi, a Computer Science student at Tribhuwan University, Nepal. I am a Python loving Data Science and Machine Learning Practitioner and a Life-long learner. I love to learn about new technologies.

I want to use this blog to help documenting my machine learning journey so that I can help others while also helping to solidify learnings and thoughts of my own.
